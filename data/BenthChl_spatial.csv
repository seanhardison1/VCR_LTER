SB T1.5,1,0,NA,427984,4125818,"In 2017, 12 new monitoring sites were added to the protocol: 6 in South Bay (SB) and 6 in Hog Island Bay (HI). These new plots are from areas of natural seagrass expansion, not from seeded plots. The variable ""Age"" is the years since seagrass first appeared in the new plots. The new plots were sampled using the protocol for 1 acre plots."
